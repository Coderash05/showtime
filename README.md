This project is inspired by websites online which allow users to browse movies and book tickets to watch movies in their preferred location. It is coded entirely on python, with the help of MySQL and python modules such as tkinter, matplotlib and mysql.connector to help facilitate this project. 
“Showtime.com” is a python-based interface which allows users to browse movies, and book tickets to their preferred movie. With various methods of sorting movies, such as by genre, rating, language, viewing the full list, or simply typing the name of whatever movie the user is looking for, it provides a user-friendly environment with clear guides. 
Upon picking a movie, the user is then allowed to view a small synopsis of the movie and view reviews left by fellow users. Here, the user can also add their own reviews, or proceed to book their own ticket, where a separate window is opened with seating options shown. This is done using tkinter, and upon confirming their seats, the user is directed to the payment confirmation. 
Once their payment is done, a ticket is generated, detailing their picked seats and the date of their showing. Finally, the movie poster is displayed, and the program ends, letting the user exit. The user can also exit at any point in the process.
